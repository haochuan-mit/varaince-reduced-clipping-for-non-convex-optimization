# Variance-reduced Clipping for Non-convex Optimization
This repository contains code for the experiments in the paper: [Variance-reduced Clipping for Non-convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00883). The code is based on the repository: [Variance Reduced Optimizers in PyTorch](https://github.com/SamuelHorvath/Variance_Reduced_Optimizers_Pytorch). 

We have provided sample commands in `./vr_optimizers/sample_commands.sh`.
